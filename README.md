# IGME531-RecodeStVictoire

This program is run by either opening the svg file included in the project, or alternatively using Live Server to open the HTML file on a local port.
primitive components can be found in the Html document, and I focused on making Sainte-Victoire en Rouge as accurate to the original as possible
(disclaimer, I completely missed the bullet asking for a variation on Sainte-Victoire and will be resubmitting with those.)
